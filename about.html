My name is Kraycious Foresighticus: beloved humanitarian, philanthropist, dog-lover, and friendly neighborhood Caucasian. I am not like other white men. I am the founder, CEO, and leader at Foresight Foundations. My hobbies include relaxing with a good book, practicing yoga, and tending to my vegetable garden. My favorite crop to plant are sweet potatoes. <br> I graduated Valedictorian summa cum laude with Highest Honors from Promepolis University and received my Masters of Science in Sustainable Agriculture. I rose to prominence with my work on Flame Combating, Anti-Burnish technology following an incident back while I was still a student. My goal is to eradicate the terror in every citizens' hearts due to the ongoing threat of Burnish Terrorism. Every day I work tirelessly towards the bettering of Promepolis and continued future of all of mankind. There is no war in Ba Sing Se.
